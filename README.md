# EvolutionaryTimeTable

This is a project given during the Java course.
In the world of computer science there are different ways and techniques to solve different types of problems using different types of algorithms.
When we come to solve a problem, we usually strive to look for the ideal, perfect solution (sometimes even the one and only).
Indeed, in many of the problems this is possible and applicable (sorting an array, scanning a graph in a certain way, etc.).
However, there is a set of "difficult" problems to solve, even using a computer.
Hard problems are problems for which the standard solution will run at an unreasonable (exponential) time depending on the input size of the problem
(the traveling agent problem, the thief problem, math chess, etc.).

For all of the above problems, there are other, different methods that can help find a solution.
In these methods we give up the desire to find the perfect and ideal solution to the problem, and are willing to "compromise" on a solution that is "good enough" for our needs.

There are numerous such algorithms, the purpose of which is to "Approximate" us for a dedicated solution.
One of them is an evolutionary algorithm.
An evolutionary algorithm draws inspiration from the natural world, and in particular from the evolutionary technique used in it.

The project consists of three parts:
Part A - Implementaion of the engine of the evolutionary algorithm and solution of a basic embedding system, while operating the system as a console application.
Part B - Expanding the algorithm engine with a number of features, while including the constraints on the hours system,
and developing a graphical display based on the Java FX (Desktop) application.
Part C - Implementation of a web application that offers an online system for sharing and distributed solution of hours systems.
